            <div class="description">
            <p> Hi, I'm Aurelia. Nice to meet you.
                This is my creative space where I want to show you some of my work since I started learning to code. I
                am naturally curious and continually working on improving my coding skills one challenge at a time. I
                have enjoyed being a QC specialist and team lead for QC APAC territories at Google Play and found my
                role as tool tester the highlight of my job. I had a lot of fun filing bugs and tracking tool
                funcionality for the engineering team. In my other full-time job I am the proud mother of a curious
                preschooler and in my spare time I engage in helping my community thrive tutoring refugees or mentoring
                young immigrants. Ocassionally I join short-term international projects with hummanitarian aid focus.
            </p>
